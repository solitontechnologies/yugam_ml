Welcome to the one day Machine Learning Workshop to be held at Kumaraguru college of Technology, Coimbatore as a part of KCT YUGAM 2016.

Please install the required software as described below and revise the necessary prerequisities to help you to make the best use of the session. We will try our best to make the workshop fun, inspiring and . Looking forward to the workshop !!!

#### Required Software and Programming Revision

1. Anaconda: Please visit [this website](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and install the Anaconda package as per your operating system. Make sure you install the correct package for you OS bit type(32/64 bit system).
Notes: 
   * Install Python 2.7 Package
   * Go to this website http://conda.pydata.org/docs/test-drive.html, to get yourself familarize with Anaconda environment.

2. [Python - Numpy and Scipy](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/intro/index.html) (Don't worry, if you have not used Python before. You can learn the basics in half a day :). Please revise the following sections from [scipy lectures](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/intro/index.html). You will not be able to test your understanding without these basics.
      * 1.1. Scientific computing with tools and workflow
      * 1.2. The Python Language
      * 1.3. NumPy:
      * 1.4. Matplotlib: Plotting
        * 1.4.2. Simple Plot 
        * 1.4.3. Figures, Subplots, Axes and Ticks
      * 1.5. Scipy:
        * 1.5.1. File input/output
        * 1.5.3. Linear algebra operations
        * 1.5.6. Statistics and random numbers
        * 1.5.9. Signal processing
        * 1.5.10. Image processing
